# Editorial Critique Memo — Fractured Code

- Multi-scale narrative is a strength; emphasize smooth transitions.
- Physical sensations of technology ground the story; amplify these.
- Choice as a theme is strong, but show more emotional variety.
- Civilian perspectives and “street-level” effects need expansion.
- Gardener presence: make more concrete and sensory.
- Alliance conflict: add personal stakes on both sides.
- Visual/formatting distinctiveness: ensure consistency.
- Action/philosophy balance: keep tension high, avoid overlong reflection.
- See full memo [attached] for detailed recommendations by section.
