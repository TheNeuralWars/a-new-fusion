# Suzanne Collins Style — Comparative Analysis & Emulation Guide

**Key Traits:**
- Present tense, first-person or close-third POV.
- Short sentences, strong verbs.
- Action interwoven with brief, revealing thoughts.
- Descriptions are functional—always in service of emotion or tension.
- Dialogue is natural, often clipped, reveals character and conflict.
- Sensory detail: taste, smell, touch frequently used to create immersion.
- Pacing: Alternates between rapid action and taut, restrained reflection.

**Emulation Tips:**
- Open scenes “in media res.”
- Use sentence fragments for impact.
- Let characters react viscerally, not just intellectually.
- Show worldbuilding through consequences, not exposition.
- Interrupt descriptions with urgent action or dialogue.

**Example:**
> I run. The world blurs. Blood in my mouth, salt and metal.  
> — “Keep moving,” she hisses.  
> My lungs burn. Behind us, the siren climbs.

- When rewriting, always ask: Does this passage move? Does it feel lived-in and urgent?
